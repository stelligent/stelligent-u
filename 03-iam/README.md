## Lesson 3.1: Introduction to Identity and Access Management

### Principle 3.1

*Identity and Access Management (IAM) is the **authentication and authorization service**
used to control access to virtually everything in AWS.*

### Practice 3.1

IAM consists of a set of services and resources that allow individuals
(and services) to authenticate with AWS and then authorizes those
entities to perform specific activities with specific services. Like
most authentication/authorization systems, IAM deals with the *concepts*
of users, groups and permissions, but not necessarily those precise
*entities*.

#### Lab 3.1.1: IAM Role

Create a CFN template that specifies an IAM Role.

- Provide values only for required attributes.

- Using inline Policies, give the Role read-only access to all IAM
  resources.

- Create the Stack.

- Use the [awscli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/index.html)
  to query the IAM service twice:

  - List all the Roles
  - Describe the specific Role your Stack created.

#### Lab 3.1.2: Customer Managed Policy

Update the template and the corresponding Stack to make the IAM Role's
inline policy more generally usable:

- Convert the IAM Role's inline Policies array to a separate
  [customer managed policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#aws-managed-policies)
  resource.

- Attach the new resource to the IAM Role.

- Update the Stack using the modified template.

#### Lab 3.1.3: Customer Managed Policy Re-Use

Update the template further to demonstrate reuse of the customer managed
policy:

- Add another IAM Role.

- Attach the customer managed policy resource to the new role.

- Be sure that you're not referencing an AWS managed policy in the
  role.

- Add/Update the Description of the customer managed policy to
  indicate the re-use of the policy.

- Update the Stack. *Did the stack update work?*

  - Query the stack to determine its state.
  - If the stack update was not successful,
    [troubleshoot and determine why](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.html#update-replacement).

#### Lab 3.1.4: AWS-Managed Policies

Replace the customer managed policy with
[AWS managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#aws-managed-policies).

- To both roles, replace the customer managed policy reference with
  the corresponding AWS managed policy granting Read permissions to
  the IAM service.

- To the second role, add an additional AWS managed policy to grant
  Read permissions to the EC2 service.

- Update the stack.

#### Lab 3.1.5: Policy Simulator

Read about the [AWS Policy Simulator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_testing-policies.html)
tool and practice using it.

- Using the two roles in your stack, simulate the ability of each role
  to perform the following actions (using the AWS CLI):

  - `iam:CreateRole`
  - `iam:ListRoles`
  - `iam:SimulatePrincipalPolicy`
  - `ec2:DescribeImages`
  - `ec2:RunInstances`
  - `ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups`

#### Lab 3.1.6: Clean Up

Clean up after yourself by deleting the stack.

### Retrospective 3.1

#### Question: Stack Outputs

_In Lab 3.1.5, you had to determine the Amazon resource Names (ARN) of the
stack's two roles in order to pass those values to the CLI function. You
probably used the AWS web console to get the ARN for each role. What
could you have done to your CFN template to make that unnecessary?_

> You can `!Ref` the policy resource to get the arn for the managed policy you create.

#### Task: Stack Outputs

Institute that change from the Question above. Recreate the stack as per
Lab 3.1.5, and demonstrate how to retrieve the ARNs.

## Lesson 3.2: Trust Relationships & Assuming Roles

### Principle 3.2

*AWS service roles and other IAM principals can assume customer created
roles, enabling a principle-of-least-privilege of permissions for AWS
services and applications.*


### Practice 3.2

An IAM Role has two kinds of policies. The first we've worked with
already and this policy type (whether inline or managed) describes
permissions the role has. The second is a trust policy, describing which
AWS principles (services, roles and users) are allowed to masquerade as
that role.

For example, an AWS Lambda Function requires an execution role that
defines the permissions the function will have when it executes. To
provide those permissions, the role must trust the AWS Lambda service to
assume it, and this trust must be granted explicitly by the role.

In these labs, you will use your IAM User to assume roles in order to
explore policies and permissions.

#### Lab 3.2.1: Trust Policy

Create a CFN template that creates an IAM Role and makes it possible for
your User to assume that role.

- The role should reference the AWS managed policy ReadOnlyAccess.

- Add a trust relationship to the role that enables your specific IAM
  user to assume that role.

- Create the stack.

- Using the AWS CLI, assume that new role. If this fails, take note of
  the error you receive, diagnose the issue and fix it.

*Hint: Instead of setting up a new profile in your \~/.aws/credentials
file, use [aws sts assume-role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_use-resources.html#using-temp-creds-sdk-cli).
It's a valuable mechanism you'll use often through the API, and it's good to
know how to do it from the CLI as well.*

#### Lab 3.2.2: Explore the assumed role

Test the capabilities of this new Role.

- Using the AWS CLI, assume that updated role and list the S3 buckets
  in the us-east-1 region.

- Acting as this role, try to create an S3 bucket using the AWS CLI.

  - Did it succeed? It should not have!
  - If it succeeded, troubleshoot how Read access allowed the role
    to create a bucket.

#### Lab 3.2.3: Add privileges to the role

Update the CFN template to give this role the ability to upload to S3
buckets.

- Create an S3 bucket.

- Using either an inline policy or an AWS managed policy, provide the
  role with S3 full access

- Update the stack.

- Assuming this role again, try to upload a text file to the bucket.

- If it failed, troubleshoot the error iteratively until the role is
  able to upload a file to the bucket.

#### Lab 3.2.4: Clean up

Clean up. Take the actions necessary to delete the stack.

### Retrospective 3.2

#### Question: Inline vs Customer Managed Policies

_In the context of an AWS User or Role, what is the difference between
an inline policy and a customer managed policy? What are the differences
between a customer managed policy and an AWS managed policy?_

#### Question: Role Assumption

_When assuming a role, are the permissions of the initial principal
mixed with those of the role being assumed?
Describe how that could easily be demonstrated with both a
[positive and negative testing](https://www.guru99.com/positive-vs-negative-testing.html)
approach._

## Lesson 3.3: Fine-Grained Controls With Policies

### Principle 3.3

*AWS policies can provide fine-grained access control to specific
resources using specific conditions.*

### Practice 3.3

So far we have only provided service-level IAM policy controls, but IAM
policies generally should be more specific than that. For example, a
service role for an application will generally only need read/write
access to those specific resources that the application uses, and even
then that resource might only be accessible under certain conditions.
[Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for AWS Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.html)
introduces the topic. We'll be exploring Resource restrictions and
Condition keys in this lesson.

Keep in mind that not all resource types support resource-level
restrictions. See the Resource-level permissions information in
[AWS Services That Work with IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html)
for details.

#### Lab 3.3.1: Unrestricted access to a service

Create a CFN template that generates two S3 buckets and a Role, and
demonstrate you have full access to each bucket with this new role.

- Code a Role your User can assume with a customer managed policy that
  allows full access to the S3 service.

- Create the stack.

- As your User:

  - list the contents of your 2 new buckets
  - upload a file to each new bucket

- Assume the new role and repeat those two checks as that role.

#### Lab 3.3.2: Resource restrictions

Add a resource restriction to the role's policy that limits full access
to the S3 service for just one of the two buckets and allows only
read-only access to the other.

- Update the stack.

- Assume the new role and perform these steps as that role:

  - List the contents of your 2 new buckets.
  - Upload a file to each new bucket.

*Were there any errors? If so, take note of them.*

*What were the results you expected, based on the role's policy?*

#### Lab 3.3.3: Conditional restrictions

Add a conditional restriction to the role's policy. Provide a condition
that grants list access only to objects that start with "lebowski/".

- Update the stack.

- Assume the new role and perform the remaining directives as that
  role.

- Try to list a file in the root of the available bucket

  - If it *worked*, fix your policy and update the stack until this
    fails.

- Try to list that same file but now with the proper object key
  prefix.

  - If it *doesn't work*, troubleshoot why and fix either the role's
    policy or the list command syntax until you are able to
    list a file.

### Retrospective

#### Question: Positive and Negative Tests

_Were the tests you ran for resource- and condition-specific
restrictions exhaustive? Did you consider additional [[positive and/or negative
tests]](https://smartbear.com/learn/automated-testing/negative-testing/)
that could be automated in order to confirm the permissions for the
Role?_

> I used the policy simulator for a lot of things. I find it helpful to include tests that you expect should fail and also tests that you expect to pass. I really should have written python or bash for automated testing, though. Looks like I get to do that next.

#### Task: Positive and Negative Tests

Code at least one new positive and one new negative test.

#### Question: Limiting Uploads

_Is it possible to limit uploads of objects with a specific prefix (e.g.
starting with "lebowski/") to an S3 bucket using IAM conditions? If not, how else
could this be accomplished?_

> Yes! You can do it similarly to the `ListBucket` command and specify the prefix in the resource name rather than as a `StringLike` conditional.

#### Task: Limiting Uploads

Research and review the best method to limit uploads with a specific prefix to
an S3 bucket.

> To set a file size limit, you can set the `content-length-range` to whatever sizes you need. Then specify the prefix in the resource of the policy.
